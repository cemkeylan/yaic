Yet Another Ii Client
=====================

`yaic` is an IRC client that wraps [ii](https://tools.suckless.org/ii) to provide
an interactive usage. It was inspired from [iii](https://github.com/c00kiemon5ter/iii),
but it has added functions, prettier output, channel switching, better compatability,
all while having less dependencies. The only dependencies are `ii` and `sh`.


TODO
----

* Add random colours based on nick.
* Highlight known nicks. (Mentions)
* Add frequently used IRC functions.
* Add a screenshot of the tool.
* Make the statusbar customizable.
